## ELIGIBILITY CONCERNS

### Issue: Growth Requirement

If DR Pty Ltd standalone doesn't show 20% growth:

**Solution 1:** Include CARSI revenue as related entity

**Solution 2:** Emphasise platform launch = exponential growth trajectory

**Solution 3:** Contact grants@desbt.qld.gov.au BEFORE 30 Jan to clarify eligibility for platform/pivot businesses

### Issue: "Reviving" Business

The grant is for "established" businesses. DR Pty Ltd has continuous registration but may have low recent activity.

**Solution:** Frame as "pivoting" rather than "reviving" - the company has operated continuously, now expanding into national technology platform.
