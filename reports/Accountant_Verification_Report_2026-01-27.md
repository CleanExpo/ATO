## Analysis Methodology

### Engine Improvements Applied (v2.0)
This analysis was conducted using the overhauled tax analysis engine with 23 critical fixes:

1. **Bank Transaction Classification** - Transactions now classified by amount sign (positive=income, negative=expense)
2. **COT/SBT Compliance** - Returns 'unknown' with professional review flag where uncertain
3. **Dynamic Tax Rates** - Entity-based rates (25% base rate / 30% standard / marginal for trusts)
4. **R&D Four-Element Test** - Weighted by dollar value, not transaction count
5. **Balanced AI Prompts** - Reduced R&D over-flagging bias
6. **Legislative Citations** - All recommendations include specific Act references
7. **Fuzzy Contact Matching** - 80% similarity threshold using Levenshtein distance
8. **Scaled Amount Tolerance** - 2%/<$1K, 1%/$1K-$50K, 0.5%/>$50K

### Confidence Levels
- **High (80-100%)**: Strong evidence, clear legislative basis
- **Medium (60-79%)**: Good evidence, may require additional documentation
- **Low (40-59%)**: Requires professional review before claiming
