## Methodology

### Analysis Approach

1. **Data Extraction:** Transactions extracted from Xero API including bank transactions, invoices, and journal entries
2. **AI Analysis:** Each transaction analysed by Gemini AI (gemini-2.0-flash-exp) for tax implications
3. **Confidence Scoring:** AI assigns confidence scores (0-100%) based on transaction clarity and deductibility certainty
4. **Benefit Calculation:** Estimated benefit = Transaction amount × 25% (small business tax rate)
5. **Adjusted Benefit:** Estimated benefit × Confidence score
6. **Net Benefit:** Adjusted benefit - Estimated accounting costs ($1,000 per recommendation)

### Tax Rate Assumptions

| Rate | Value | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| Small Business Tax Rate | 25% | Section 23AA ITAA 1936 |
| R&D Tax Offset (if applicable) | 43.5% | Division 355 ITAA 1997 |
| Standard Corporate Rate | 30% | Section 23 ITAA 1936 |

### Confidence Adjustment

Benefits are adjusted by confidence score to provide conservative estimates:
- 90-100%: Full benefit expected
- 70-89%: Good likelihood of claim success
- 50-69%: Moderate uncertainty, professional review recommended
- Below 50%: High uncertainty, excluded from recommendations
