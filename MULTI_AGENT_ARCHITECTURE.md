## 1. Overview & Philosophy

### Framework Purpose

This multi-agent architecture framework provides a formalized development hierarchy that coordinates specialist agents, enforces quality standards, and integrates with Linear project management for transparent task tracking.

### Key Benefits

1. **Clear Authority Hierarchy** - Developer → Senior PM → Orchestrator → Specialists (A/B/C/D)
2. **Parallel Execution** - Specialists work concurrently in isolated contexts
3. **Quality Enforcement** - Automated quality gates before phase transitions
4. **Linear Integration** - Real-time task tracking and progress visibility
5. **Context Isolation** - Prevents cross-contamination between specialist work
6. **Reusable Pattern** - Applicable to both ATO development and client projects

### Integration with Existing ATO Agent Fleet

This framework operates **alongside** the existing 18 tax domain agents:

- **Framework agents** (Orchestrator + 4 Specialists) handle **development process**
- **Tax agents** (18 specialists) handle **domain-specific tax analysis**
- Both agent types coordinate through the Orchestrator

Framework specification continues with sections 2-10 covering hierarchical structure, communication protocols, workflows, Linear integration, quality gates, context management, metrics, commands, and tax agent integration.
