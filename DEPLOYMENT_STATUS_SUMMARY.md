## ⚠️ ONLY 2 THINGS LEFT TO DO:

### 1. Add Supabase Keys to Vercel (5 minutes)

**Get the keys:**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xwqymjisxmtcmaebcehw/settings/api
2. Find "Project API keys" section
3. Copy BOTH keys (they're different!):
   - `anon` / `public` key
   - `service_role` key

**Add to Vercel:**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/team-agi/ato-app/settings/environment-variables
2. Click "Add New" twice:
   - Name: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` → Value: [your anon key]
   - Name: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` → Value: [your service_role key]
3. Select "Production" environment
4. Click "Save"

### 2. Wait for Auto-Deployment (1 minute)

After adding the keys, Vercel will automatically redeploy the latest code from GitHub.
