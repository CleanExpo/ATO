## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Missing Environment Variables

**You must add these TWO Supabase keys to Vercel before deployment will work:**

### Required Actions:

1. **Get your Supabase keys:**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xwqymjisxmtcmaebcehw/settings/api
   - Find the "Project API keys" section
   - Copy BOTH keys (they're different!)

2. **Add to Vercel:**

   **Option A: Via Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/unite-group/ato/settings/environment-variables
   - Click "Add New"
   - Name: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - Value: [paste your anon key]
   - Environment: Production
   - Click "Save"
   - Repeat for `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` [paste your service_role key]

   **Option B: Via Vercel CLI**
   ```bash
   cd ato-app
   echo "YOUR_ANON_KEY" | vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY production --scope team-agi
   echo "YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" | vercel env add SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY production --scope team-agi
   ```

3. **Trigger Deployment:**
   After adding the keys, Vercel will automatically redeploy, OR you can manually trigger:
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/unite-group/ato/deployments
   - Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

Once deployed, test these URLs:

### Health Check
```
https://ato-app-phi.vercel.app/api/health
```
Should return: `{"status": "healthy", ...}`

### Dashboard
```
https://ato-app-phi.vercel.app/dashboard
```
Should load immediately (no authentication required)

### Xero OAuth
```
https://ato-app-phi.vercel.app/dashboard
```
Click "Connect Xero" → Should redirect to Xero login

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If health check shows "unhealthy":
- Check environment variables are set correctly in Vercel
- Check Vercel deployment logs for specific errors
- Verify all Supabase keys are correct

### If dashboard shows 500 error:
- Check browser console for errors
- Check Vercel function logs
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is correct

### If Xero OAuth fails:
- Verify Xero Client ID and Secret are correct
- Check redirect URL matches in Xero dashboard:
  - Should be: `https://ato-app-phi.vercel.app/api/auth/xero/callback`
