## Tomorrow's Focus

### Ready to Accept Developer Requests

The framework is production-ready and awaiting first real-world project assignment:

1. **Developer Request Intake**: Ready to receive via `npm run senior-pm:orchestrate`
2. **Task Decomposition**: Orchestrator prepared to analyze and distribute work
3. **Specialist Activation**: All 4 specialists (A/B/C/D) available for assignment
4. **Quality Gates**: All 6 automated gates ready for enforcement
5. **Linear Tracking**: Parent/sub-issue creation and status updates configured

### Recommended Next Steps

1. Submit a real developer request to test Linear integration end-to-end
2. Monitor quality gate pass rates in production
3. Track cycle time and blocker resolution metrics
4. Refine task decomposition based on actual project complexity
