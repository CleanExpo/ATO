# G-Pilot: Australian Tax Optimization (ATO) Audit Suite

## 🚀 Mission Statement
The G-Pilot ATO Suite is an elite forensic analysis system for **Business Owners ($990)** and **Accountants ($495)**. It is designed to act as an **Auditing Tool** to discover hidden tax benefits, identify misclassifications, and optimize financial positions. We provide the **Audit Outline**—identifying candidate items for professional review and remediation.

## 🏛️ Core Sovereignty
1. **Forensic Assistance Only**: This is NOT a DIY Tax Machine. We identify candidates; the Human Professional (Owner or Accountant) executes.
2. **Professional Layer Partnership**: Designed to provide Accountants with high-fidelity discovery data to on-charge as a "Tax Health Check" advisory service.
3. **Legal & Ethical Absolute**: Every discovery is mapped to Division/Section legislation in ITAA 1997/1936.
4. **Read-Only Integrity**: We analyze and report; we never modify source ledgers.
