# R&D TAX INCENTIVE REGISTRATION GUIDE
## CARSI Pty Ltd - Online Training Platform Development

Prepared: 24 January 2026
Legislation: Division 355, Income Tax Assessment Act 1997

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

CARSI Pty Ltd has invested approximately $36,756 in computer equipment (likely training platform infrastructure) and has accumulated losses of $98,248. The development of an IICRC-accredited online training platform may qualify for the **R&D Tax Incentive** under Division 355.

**Potential Benefit:**
- R&D Offset Rate: **43.5%** (turnover under $20M)
- Estimated Eligible Expenditure: $80,000 - $150,000
- Potential Tax Offset: **$34,800 - $65,250**

As CARSI has accumulated losses, the R&D offset would be a **refundable tax offset** - meaning cash back from the ATO.

## PART 8: COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

### 1. Retrospective Documentation
**Problem:** Creating documentation after the fact
**Solution:** Maintain contemporaneous records throughout development

### 2. Overclaiming Routine Activities
**Problem:** Including normal software development as R&D
**Solution:** Only claim activities with genuine technical uncertainty

### 3. Missing Registration Deadline
**Problem:** Failing to register before 10-month deadline
**Solution:** Set calendar reminders, register early

### 4. Inadequate Time Records
**Problem:** Cannot prove staff allocation to R&D
**Solution:** Implement timesheet system with R&D codes

### 5. No Experimental Evidence
**Problem:** Cannot demonstrate experiments were conducted
**Solution:** Document hypotheses, tests, and results
