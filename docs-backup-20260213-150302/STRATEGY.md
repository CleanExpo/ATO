## 🏛️ Positioning: "The Audit Outline"
This application is **NOT a DIY Tax Machine**. It is a **Forensic Assistance Tool**.
- **Nature**: An intelligent scanner that identifies "Candidate Items" for tax optimization.
- **Outcome**: Generates an **Audit Outline** and **Value Discovery Report**.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: All findings are designed to be reviewed and implemented by a qualified professional (CA/CPA) or a knowledgeable business owner.
