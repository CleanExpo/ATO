## Mandatory Report Elements

### TASA 2009 Disclaimer (Required on Every Page)

```
DISCLAIMER: This analysis is generated by automated software and does not
constitute tax, financial, or legal advice. It is provided for informational
purposes only. All findings and recommendations should be reviewed by a
registered tax agent or qualified tax professional before any action is taken.
This software is not registered with the Tax Practitioners Board and does
not provide tax agent services within the meaning of the Tax Agent Services
Act 2009 (TASA).
```

- Minimum font size: **12px** (compliance requirement from audit)
- Minimum opacity: **60%** (must be legible)
- Placement: Footer of every page + dedicated final page

### ESTIMATE Labelling

All dollar amounts in reports must be labelled:
- **"(Est.)"** suffix on individual amounts
- **"ESTIMATE ONLY"** header on summary totals
- Confidence level indicator: High / Medium / Low

### Data Provenance Block

Every report must include:

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Data source | Xero (READ-ONLY API) |
| Organisations analysed | DR Pty Ltd, DR Family Trust |
| Transactions analysed | 5,230 |
| Financial years | FY2022-23, FY2023-24, FY2024-25 |

| Report generated | 2026-02-13T10:00:00+11:00 |
| Report ID | RPT-2026-0213-001 |

## PDF Generation Methods

### Option 1: Server-Side (Recommended for Production)

Use Puppeteer or Playwright to render HTML → PDF:

| Tool | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| **Puppeteer** | Full Chrome rendering, CSS support | Heavy (300MB+ Chromium) |
| **@react-pdf/renderer** | React components → PDF, lightweight | Limited CSS support |
| **jsPDF** | Client-side, no server dependency | Manual layout, no CSS |
| **PDFKit** | Node.js native, programmatic | Manual layout |

### Option 2: HTML Template + CSS Print Styles

Generate styled HTML with `@media print` CSS, then convert to PDF:

```css
@media print {
  .no-print { display: none; }
  .page-break { page-break-before: always; }
  .disclaimer { font-size: 12px; opacity: 0.6; }
}
```

## Report Styling

| Element | Style | Rationale |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Font | Inter or Geist (body), JetBrains Mono (numbers) | Matches app design system |
| Page size | A4 (210mm × 297mm) | Australian standard |
| Margins | 20mm all sides | Professional formatting |
| Header | Entity name + FY + page number | Context on every page |
| Footer | Disclaimer text + report ID | Compliance requirement |
| Tables | Zebra striping, right-aligned numbers | Readability |
| Amounts | `$XX,XXX.XX (Est.)` format | Clarity + estimate labelling |
| Legislation refs | Bold, linked to ATO source | Verifiability |

## Output Format

```xml
<pdf_report_metadata>
  <report_id>RPT-2026-0213-001</report_id>
  <report_type>executive_summary</report_type>
  <entity_name>DR Pty Ltd</entity_name>
  <financial_year>FY2024-25</financial_year>
  <generated_at>2026-02-13T10:00:00+11:00</generated_at>
  <page_count>7</page_count>
  <file_size_kb>245</file_size_kb>
  <file_path>/tmp/reports/RPT-2026-0213-001.pdf</file_path>
  <includes_disclaimer>true</includes_disclaimer>
  <includes_provenance>true</includes_provenance>
  <estimate_labelling>true</estimate_labelling>
</pdf_report_metadata>
```

## Best Practices

- **Always include the TASA 2009 disclaimer** — legal compliance requirement
- **Label all dollar amounts as estimates** — platform is not a tax agent
- **Include data provenance** — users and accountants need to verify data source
- **Use A4 page size** — Australian standard, accountants expect it
- **Right-align all numeric columns** — accounting convention
- **Include legislation references** — adds credibility and verifiability
- **Watermark draft reports** — "DRAFT — FOR REVIEW ONLY" until accountant approves
- **Never include raw Xero data** — only classified and aggregated results
- **Secure PDF generation** — don't expose file paths to client; use signed URLs
