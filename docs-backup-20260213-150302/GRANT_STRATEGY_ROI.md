## 🚀 2. The Growth Narrative: Project "Resilience Scale"

**Proposed Project:** Acquisition of Advanced Forensic Data Recovery Infrastructure.

### The Problem
Current growth is bottlenecked by the processing speed of legacy hardware. High-demand disaster events (floods, cyber-attacks) result in backlogs that limit the company's ability to serve more than 3 enterprise clients simultaneously.

### The Innovation
Acquisition of **"Ultra-Density Rapid Remediation Clusters"** (Specialized Equipment).
- 4x AI-Accelerated Forensic Servers
- High-Speed NVMe Recovery Array (Industrial Grade)
- Mobile On-Site Remediation Unit (Custom Rig)

### Economic Impact for Queensland
1. **Employment**: Will require 2 additional Specialized Forensic Technicians (FTE) within 6 months.
2. **Productivity**: 300% increase in data recovery throughput.
3. **Resilience**: Enhances Queensland's ability to recover from major regional cyber and natural disasters.
